The project will use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports that allow users to view sales data from various angles, such as sales by product, sales by region, and sales by customer. These reports can be filtered, sorted, and drilled down to provide deeper insights into the data.
Overall, the Ecommerce Sales Using Power BI Project is a valuable tool for ecommerce businesses looking to gain a deeper understanding of their sales performance and make data-driven decisions. By using Power BI to analyze their data, businesses can identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement, ultimately leading to increased profitability and growth.
